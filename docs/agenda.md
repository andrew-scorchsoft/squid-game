# Squid Game Garden Party – Full Event Agenda

## Overview

This agenda outlines a full-day Squid Game themed party designed for approximately 20-25 guests over 7 hours (11:00 AM - 6:00 PM). The event combines competitive games with social elements, featuring 6 main elimination games that progressively narrow the field to determine a final champion. 

Players start with coins and use a handicap system to gain advantages, while eliminated participants become "guards" who help run subsequent games. The schedule includes strategic meal breaks, buffer periods for transitions, and optional side activities like the lockbox treasure hunt that runs throughout the day. 

With proper preparation and time management, this format delivers an immersive, competitive experience that balances intense gameplay with socializing and food service.

## Timing Feasibility & Tips

* The schedule fits within the 11:00 – 18:00 window **provided games start at 12:20 sharp** and buffers are respected.
* Lunch is the longest downtime; 45 min is enough to feed ~25 guests on a 4-burner griddle if ingredients are pre-prepped.
* Assign two "float" helpers to reset games during preceding buffer periods – this prevents overruns.
* If a main game runs long, shave minutes from the next break **not** the next game.
* Keep a visible clock and have a guard call 5-minute warnings.
* Bad-weather fallback: switch to indoor backup games (see agenda notes in `docs/games.md`).

> **Bottom line:** With disciplined time-keeping and pre-staged equipment, finishing by 18:00 is achievable.
