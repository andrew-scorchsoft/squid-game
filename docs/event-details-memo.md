# 🔺 **THE FINAL SUMMONS** 🔺

Operation Codename: **“Garden Game #456”**  
Classification: **CONFIDENTIAL – Players’ Eyes Only**  

---

DEAR PLAYER,

Your **Ddakji** victory has granted you entry to **Aimee & Rachel’s Birthday Experience** — a single-day contest of cunning, courage, and coin. The Front Man commends your nerve. Now the real test begins.

Prepare yourself for a series of escalating challenges that will pit friend against friend, rewarding only the sharpest minds (and the luckiest feet). The games remain shrouded in secrecy, but heed the vital timings below:

## Key Timings

| Time | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **11:00** | Gates open – report to registration, collect starting coins, submit your £5 ante. Early birds may hone skills in an *Arrival Minigame*. |
| **12:00** | Opening Ceremony – miss this call and risk elimination before the first whistle. |
| **13:00** | Mid-day rations sizzle on the four-burner griddle. Fuel up; you’ll need the strength. |
| **18:30** | Final siren – coins tallied, champion crowned, debts settled. |
| **After-Hours** (Optional)| Survivors, guards, and fallen comrades reconvene for feast & evning entertainment in the Social Room until voices (or nerves) give out. |

Please aim to arrive between **11-11:30 am** to provide a buffer.

## Uniform Protocol

Your survival depends on conformity. Report dressed in regulation **green outfits** – the closer to authentic contestant attire, the better your chances. Those who dare may display their **player number** with pride.

Deviation from dress code may result in... consequences. 

## What To Bring

1. Your game-face and willingness to embrace the unknown.
2. Comfortable outdoor clothing and footwear (*running heels will not save you*).
4. A working knowledge of **Squid Game** – Ideally having watched Season One, but at minimum the Season One Netflix trailer. *Ignorance is not bliss here.*

## House Rules

- Arrive unmasked; leave as whoever the games allow you to become.
- Elimination does not end your duty
- Bribery, alliances, and dramatic flair are encouraged, but violence and spoilers are forbidden.

## Survival Tips

- Listen for the guards’ instructions – disobedience costs lives and risks ELIMINATION.
- Keep your friends close, and your umbrellas closer.

Failure to present yourself on time or comply with the rules will result in immediate forfeiture of pride, and possibly your life. Choose wisely, play boldly, and remember:

> **Only a single player leaves with the prize. Will it be you?**

May the odds flip in your favour,  
— **The Front Man**
