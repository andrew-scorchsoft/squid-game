## Opening Ceremony

**Players,**

Welcome to your final test. You have been selected not by chance, but by your demonstrated willingness to risk everything for the possibility of reward. Today, 456 billion won would be approximately £300 million. Your prize pool may be more modest, but the principles remain unchanged.

You stand here because your lives have led you to this moment—a moment where ordinary games become matters of survival. Six games await you. Each designed to test different aspects of human nature: speed, precision, trust, teamwork, courage, and cunning.

The rules are simple:
- Win, and you advance
- Lose, and you are eliminated  
- Elimination means the forfeiture of all coins and your £5 deposit to the prize pool
- Only one player will claim ultimate victory

But know this: fate is not immutable. Throughout these trials, you will face choices that extend beyond the games themselves. Advantages may be purchased with your precious coins—extra time, favorable positions, the power to alter another's destiny. Each coin spent is a calculated risk. Will you hoard your resources, or will you spend them to tip the scales in your moment of greatest need?

Additionally, challenges may arise between our scheduled trials. A call to marbles—where any player may challenge another to a direct duel, each risking one coin, winner takes both. A whispered dare. A chance to double your fortune or lose it all. These opportunities will test not just your skill, but your judgment. When fortune knocks, will you have the courage to answer?

Some of you may even discover... other pathways. Hidden challenges that run parallel to our main events. Seek them out, if you dare. But remember: every choice has consequences, and every gamble carries the risk of total loss.

Guards, take your positions. Players, remember—fairness is guaranteed, but mercy is not. Your coins are your lifeline, your strategy, and your salvation. Spend them wisely.

Let the games begin.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- Each player starts with 3 coins
- Players must deposit £5 note publicly when eliminated (lose all coins)
- Advantages can be purchased before most games for 1 coin
- Marbles challenge: any player can challenge another once ever, both must stake 1 coin, winner takes both coins, can only be used once per player across entire event
- Lockbox treasure hunt runs throughout the day
- Prize pool grows with each elimination

## Game #1: Red Light, Green Light

**Players,**

Your first trial draws from the innocence of childhood, now stripped of its joy. Before you lies a simple challenge that has eliminated more contestants than any other in our history.

**The Rules:**
- When you hear "GREEN LIGHT," you may move toward the finish line
- When you hear "RED LIGHT," you must freeze completely
- Any movement during red light results in immediate elimination
- Running is forbidden—those who cannot restrain their desperation will be removed
- First to cross the finish line in each group will be rewarded

Some of you will reach for advantages. Remember: every coin spent is a gamble. Will your three-step head start prove decisive, or will you watch others overtake you while your resources dwindle?

Speed without control leads to elimination. Control without speed leads to defeat.

Choose wisely.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** 1 coin = start 3 paces forward
- **Winner:** +2 coins | **Survivor:** 0 coins | **Eliminated:** -1 coin
- Split into groups of 3-5 players, 5 minutes per group
- Power walking only - runners are eliminated

## Game #2: Sugar Shapes

**Players,**

Your second trial tests patience and precision. Before you lie the sugar shapes—delicate puzzles that demand steady hands and steadier nerves.

What appears to be candy is, in reality, a test of character. The umbrella shape has broken the hopes of countless players. The circle has saved others through its simplicity. You will not know your fate until the envelope is opened.

**The Rules:**
- Extract your shape completely without breaking it
- You have 10 minutes
- Failure results in elimination
- Success with the umbrella shape brings reward
- Tools are provided, but they are as likely to destroy as to save you

Some may choose to alter their destiny through our advantage system. Remember: every swap is a gamble with fate. Will you burden another with the umbrella, or will you find it thrust upon you?

The shapes do not lie. Your hands will reveal your worthiness.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** 1 coin = swap your shape with someone else OR force two others to swap
- **Failed extraction:** -1 coin | **Completed umbrella:** +1 coin | **Other shapes:** 0 coins
- 10 minute time limit
- If multiple buy handicaps after reveal, those who swapped can't swap again

## Game #3: Prisoners Dilemma

**Players,**

Your third trial strips away all pretense. Here, we explore the mathematics of betrayal.

You have formed bonds during your time here. Some of you may call others "friend." Today, we quantify the value of such relationships.

**The Rules:**
- You will be paired at random
- Each pair must choose: COOPERATE or BETRAY
- Mutual cooperation yields mutual reward
- Mutual betrayal yields mutual punishment  
- One cooperation and one betrayal... creates a winner and a victim

Thirty seconds of discussion. An eternity of consequence.

Those who purchase additional time believe words can change hearts. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps they merely delay the inevitable revelation of character.

Trust is a luxury. Betrayal is a tool. Choose according to your nature.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** 1 coin = 60 seconds discussion instead of 30
- **Both Cooperate:** Both +1 coin | **Both Betray:** Both -1 coin
- **One Cooperates, One Betrays:** Betrayer +2 coins, Cooperator -2 coins
- Pair up all players randomly

## Game #4: Hoop Rock Paper Scissors

**Players,**

Your fourth trial introduces the element of chance—or does it? What appears random often reveals deeper patterns of human behavior.

Teams are necessary now. Individual strength means nothing without collective strategy. Yet every team contains the seeds of its own destruction.

**The Rules:**
- Two teams advance through hoops toward enemy territory
- Rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, paper defeats rock
- Victory advances you; defeat sends you to the back of the line
- The first to reach the enemy's starting position wins for their entire team

Observe how quickly alliances form when survival depends upon others. Observe how readily those same allies will sacrifice you when the burden becomes too great.

Those eliminated today will discover that the games continue—merely from a different perspective.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** Team betting = start one hoop forward per coin bet
- **Winning team:** +1 coin per member | **Losing team:** -1 coin per member
- 20 hoops total, two-footed jumps only
- Losing team members go to "target practice" with guards

**— The Front Man**

## Game #5: Glass Walkway

**Players,**

Your fifth trial requires faith—not in any deity, but in probability, preparation, and perhaps the weakness of others.

Before you stretches a bridge of choices. Each step forward is a decision between safety and destruction. The mathematics are simple: some of you will fall, and some will learn from their sacrifice.

**The Rules:**
- Cross the bridge by choosing the correct tiles in sequence
- Choose incorrectly, and pay one coin to try again
- Refuse to pay, and accept elimination
- Order is determined by numbered cards
- Advantages may be purchased to alter your fate
- Each option labelled heads or tails
- Guard pick the killer tile before you advance

This game rewards neither speed nor strength, but the ability to learn from the failures of those who go before you. Every step taken by another player is information. Use it wisely.

Those who go first face uncertainty. Those who go last face expectation. Which burden would you choose?

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Advantage:** +1 coin = can swap numbers with any other player
- **First to cross:** +3 coins | **Successfully crossed:** 0 coins | **Failed:** Eliminated
- 6 pairs of tiles, guards know safe pattern
- Wrong choice = pay 1 coin to try again or be eliminated
- Highest number advantage holders get first pick on swaps

## Game #6: Poker Round

**Players,**

Your sixth trial abandons pretense entirely. This is pure competition—mind against mind, will against will. The child's games are over. Now we play as adults, with adult stakes.

**The Rules:**
- All coins become chips
- Standard poker rules apply
- Elimination occurs when chips are exhausted
- Only the final survivor advances to the finale
- One representative from our eliminated guards may also advance if they can prove their worth

Poker is mathematics tempered by psychology. It rewards those who can read others while remaining unreadable themselves. Every bet is a statement of confidence. Every fold is an admission of weakness.

Yet luck still has a voice at this table. The strongest hand means nothing if the heart lacks courage to bet it.

Your coins represent more than currency now—they represent time. Spend them wisely.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Exchange rate:** 1 coin = 10 poker chips
- Play until only 1 player remains with chips
- Guards also play separate poker game - winner advances if they beat 2nd place from main game
- Standard Texas Hold'em rules

**— The Front Man**

## Finale: Giant Jenga

**Players,**

You have reached the end. Two remain, as was always intended. Your final trial is both simple and profound: the careful removal of support until everything collapses.

**The Rules:**
- Take turns removing blocks from the tower
- The player who causes the collapse loses everything
- The survivor claims all remaining coins and the title of champion

This game mirrors your journey. You have carefully removed the supports of friendship, trust, and mercy. Now we discover whose foundation was strongest.

Steady hands and steadier nerves will determine our champion. But remember—even the most careful player must eventually take a risk that could bring everything crashing down.

One of you will walk away with everything. The other will learn the true meaning of having nothing.

Make your choice.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Winner:** Takes all remaining coins and is declared Squid Game Champion
- **Runner-up:** Receives consolation prize (optional)
- Players who cause tower to fall lose everything

**— The Front Man**

## Closing Ceremony

**Players and Guards,**

Today's games have concluded. We have witnessed triumph and defeat, courage and cowardice, loyalty and betrayal. These games do not create character—they merely reveal it.

To our champion: You have demonstrated the qualities necessary to succeed when everything is at stake. Your victory is earned through the defeats of others. Remember them.

To our eliminated players: Your journey ends here, but your service continues. The games require witnesses. You have seen what happens when desperation meets opportunity.

The prize pool has found its rightful owner. The debts have been settled. Justice, in its purest mathematical form, has been served.

Until we meet again—and we always meet again—remember this day. Remember what you learned about yourself and others.

The games are complete, but their lessons endure.

**— The Front Man**

## Bad Weather Backup Games

### Alternative Game #1: Group Marbles Championship

**Players,**

The elements have forced us indoors, but they cannot stop the games. Your first trial adapts to our constraints while maintaining its essential truth: precision under pressure reveals character.

Teams are necessary now. Individual skill means nothing without collective strategy. Yet observe how quickly teammates become rivals when points are tallied.

**The Rules:**
- Teams of 3-4 players compete in marbles accuracy
- Each round, every team member shoots once toward the golden target
- Closest earns 3 points, second earns 2, third earns 1
- Five rounds determine team rankings
- Advantages grant extra shots to those willing to pay

The target does not move, yet your aim will waver. Pressure transforms the steady hand into trembling uncertainty. Will your team support your weakness, or will they quietly calculate your replacement?

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** 1 coin = team gets extra shot each round
- **Winning team:** +2 coins per member | **Second place:** 0 coins | **Other teams:** -1 coin per member
- Teams of 3-4 players, 5 rounds total
- Scoring: Closest = 3 pts, Second = 2 pts, Third = 1 pt

### Alternative Game #4: Seated Rock Paper Scissors Tournament

**Players,**

When movement is restricted, the mind becomes the only battlefield. This trial strips away physical advantage and leaves only psychological warfare.

You sit as equals now. No running, no positioning, no hiding behind others. Just you, your opponent, and the mathematics of choice.

**The Rules:**
- Single elimination tournament format
- Best of three in each match
- Winners advance through the bracket until one remains
- Advantages allow you to see your opponent's choice once per tournament

Rock, paper, scissors—three choices that have decided the fate of children and emperors alike. The game appears random, yet patterns emerge in human behavior. The desperate favor rock. The clever choose paper. The cautious default to scissors.

Which pattern defines you?

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Handicap:** 1 coin = see opponent's choice once per tournament
- **Tournament Winner:** +2 coins | **Final Two:** +1 coin | **Semifinals:** 0 coins | **Others:** -1 coin
- Best of 3 matches, single elimination bracket

### Alternative Finale: Quarto

**Players,**

Your final trial demands a different kind of precision. Before you lies not a tower to topple, but a grid to master. Victory comes not from destruction, but from forcing your opponent to create what they seek to avoid.

**The Rules:**
- You select pieces for your opponent to place
- Four-in-a-row of any shared attribute ends the game
- The player forced to create the line loses everything
- Two rounds determine our champion as before

This game mirrors the deeper truth of our competition: sometimes the greatest victory comes from making others accomplish your goals. Every piece you give your opponent is both a gift and a curse.

Choose carefully. In Quarto, as in life, good intentions can create your own defeat.

**GAME MASTER NOTES:**
- **Winner:** Takes all coins and is declared Squid Game Champion
- **Round 1:** Guards winner vs 2nd place poker player
- **Round 2:** Round 1 winner vs 1st place poker player
- 4x4 grid, 16 pieces with 4 attributes each
