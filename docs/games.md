### 5.5. Sudden Death Marbles (optional if high player count remains)

When we played glass walkway we ended up with 11 people out of 20 making it through because a high coin count playwr went first.

To solve this we introduced a sudden death mmables game between rounds 5 and 6. Players had to form pairs, then we played them against eachother. Loser was eliminated regardless of coin count.

As we had odd numbers, we allowed one group of three where the two losers of the team were eliminated. Brutal but effective.
