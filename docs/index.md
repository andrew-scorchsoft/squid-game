## TL;DR for Organisers

1. **Three days before** – finish Dalgona candies, confirm equipment, buy food, assign roles.
2. **Morning of** – set up game zones, brief staff, verify safety, prep coins.
3. **Stick to the clock** – Red Light starts 12:15, lunch 13:00 sharp, finale by 17:45.
4. **Eliminated players = manpower** – pivot them into Guard roles to keep flow smooth.
5. **Capture the drama** – designate a media guard for photos & short clips.
6. **Weather turns?** – switch to indoor backup games (outlined in Games Handbook).

> *Remember: tension, fairness, and spectacle are the pillars of a perfect Squid Game.*

Happy hosting ‑ and may the best (or craftiest) player win!
