# Lockbox Treasure Hunt - Home Game Setup

## Overview
The Lockbox Treasure Hunt is a side challenge that runs throughout your Squid Game party. Players must solve a series of riddles and clues hidden around the house to ultimately find the secret lockbox containing bonus coins. Each clue contains a single digit that, when combined in sequence, forms the combination needed to open the lockbox. This creates an ongoing puzzle that players can work on between main games.

**Security Feature:** Even if players find clues out of order or stumble upon the lockbox early, they still need all four code fragments to unlock it, preventing premature completion.

**Recommended Timing:** 
- Setup: 30 minutes before party
- Duration: Runs throughout entire event
- Difficulty: Medium (requires 4-6 clues to solve)
