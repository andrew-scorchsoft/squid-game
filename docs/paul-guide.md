# Paul's Guide: The Beneficial Plant

## Character Overview
Paul acts as the "older gentleman" figure - a secret ally who appears to be just another player but strategically assists his chosen protégé throughout the games, mirroring the character from the original Squid Game series. Nobody will know paul so this should help create a narrative of mystery.

## Selection Process
- Paul secretly chooses his target player during the arrival phase (suggest observing during Ddakji Challenge) and lets Aimee/Andrew know.
- Paul should not reveal his assistance role to anyone, including his chosen player
- Goal is to help his chosen player survive and advance while maintaining plausible deniability

## General Guidelines for Paul
- Act naturally concerned about your own survival while subtly helping your chosen player
- Provide assistance that seems coincidental or strategically beneficial to yourself
- If directly asked about helping, deflect with comments about "teamwork" or "better odds together"
- Create dramatic moments by appearing to consider betraying your player before ultimately helping
- Maintain the illusion that you're playing for yourself - never make it obvious you're helping

### Ddakji Challenge (Arrival)

**Paul's Opportunities:**
(If Paul is here for this part of the day)

- **Player Selection:** Observe players during this game to choose who to assist
- **Skill Assessment:** Watch for players who seem nervous, inexperienced, or kind-hearted
- **Initial Contact:** Strike up casual conversation with your chosen player
- **Confidence Building:** If your chosen player loses, offer encouraging words about "beginner's luck running out" for others

- **Strategic Positioning:** Start near his chosen player to provide physical cover during freezing
- **Coaching:** Loudly give "general advice" that specifically helps his player ("Stay low when you freeze!"

### Sugar Shapes (Dalgona Candy Challenge)

**Paul's Assistance Opportunities:**

- **Shape Swapping:** Use his handicap to swap his easier shape with his chosen player's difficult shape. Paul will be told by games master which line to stand in to get the triangle piece, which is  the easiest.
- **Technique Tips:** Loudly share "general advice" that specifically helps with his player's shape whilst trying not to let others hear ("You know, I heard licking the edges helps with stars...")

### Prisoners Dilemma

**Paul's Assistance Opportunities:**

- **Direct Partnership:** Paul specifically requests to partner with his chosen player
- **Strategic Cooperation:** Always cooperate with his chosen player for mutual +1 coin gain
- **Psychological Manipulation:** If not partnered with his player, Paul can influence his own partner's decision through misdirection or intimidation to affect overall coin distribution favorably. Though both parties splitting is considered a success, bonus cudos for paul if his opponent steals from Paul to earn an additional coin from paul.
- **Information Warfare:** Spread rumors or advice to other teams that benefit his player's position
- **Handicap Usage:** Buy the extended discussion time to better coordinate with his chosen player

### Hoop Rock Paper Scissors

**Paul's Assistance Opportunities:**

- **Team Placement:** Maneuver to be on the same team as his chosen player
- **Strategic Betting if on same teams:** If teams can bet coins for starting advantages, Paul sacrifices his coins for team benefit, even if this increases the risk of elimination for Paul.
- **Throw Coordination if on opposing teams:** Deliberately throw hands or signal choice early to lose against chosen player or chosen players team if playing head to head.

### Glass Walkway

**Paul's Assistance Opportunities:**

- **Advantage Purchase:** Paul buys the advantage specifically to swap numbers with his chosen player, giving them a better crossing position
- **Information Sharing:** If Paul goes first and survives some tiles, he can "accidentally" give away safe tile information through body language or comments
- **Coin Sacrifice:** If his player falls, Paul can loudly offer to pay for their retry, making it seem like a desperate alliance rather than planned assistance
- **Psychological Warfare:** Create doubt in other players about tile safety to slow them down

### Poker Round

**Paul's Assistance Opportunities:**

- **Chip Donation:** "Accidentally" lose hands to his chosen player or fold when he has winning hands against them
- **Strategic Elimination:** Target other strong players to eliminate competition for his chosen player
- **Information Sharing:** Subtly reveal his hand strength through betting patterns or tells that only his player might notice
- **Alliance Building:** Publicly form a "temporary alliance" with his player that seems strategic but is actually one-sided assistance
- **Final Two Strategy:** If both Paul and his player reach the final two, Paul should dramatically "give it his all" before ultimately losing in a believable way


### Giant Jenga Finale

Paul should aim to not be in this game by going all-in in poker or something similar to sacrafice his position. Ideally there should be a moment of sacrafice that happens in any of the games leading up to this point where Paul loses his last coin to protect the other player.

At the point of 'losing' paul should reveal his role in events.

### Creating Drama

- When questioned: "I'm just trying to stay alive like everyone else. Sometimes that means working with others."
- When sacrificing: "I've lived my life. You've got more to lose than I do."
- When deflecting suspicion: "You think I'm some kind of mastermind? I'm just an old man trying to survive."

### If Paul Must Eliminate His Player
